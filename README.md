# Gov Rewind – Landing Page

This repository contains the static website for **Gov Rewind**, a browser extension that helps users view earlier versions of selected U.S. government (.gov) webpages.

The site is intentionally simple:

- A single static HTML page (`index.html`) served via GitHub Pages.
- A small set of static assets (such as icons) referenced by the page.
- No build system, frameworks, or external dependencies are required.

The primary purpose of this repository is to host the public landing page for Gov Rewind at:

> https://govrewind.supjessica.com  
> (via GitHub Pages and this repository: https://github.com/SupJessica/GovRewind-Website)

Because the page is static and self-contained, this repository should remain valid even as the extension itself evolves over time. Updates to the page content or styling may happen occasionally, but there is no expectation of frequent changes.

## Local preview

If you want to view or work with this page locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/SupJessica/GovRewind-Website.git
    cd GovRewind-Website

2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve it with any simple static file server.

No additional tooling is required.
